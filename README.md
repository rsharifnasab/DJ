## FAQ

#### Do I need this as a student?

No you don't. The course TA should clone this repository and create questions and then distribute questions alongside the judge and the binary for you.

#### Do I Have to learn Go before using this project?

No you don't. The flexible part is not programmed in Go, but instead you need a bit of bash script knowledge to tune judges and develop creative questions.
